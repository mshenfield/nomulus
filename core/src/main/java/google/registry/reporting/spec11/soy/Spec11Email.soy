  Dear registrar partner,

  <p>{$registry} previously notified you when the following domains managed by your
    registrar were flagged for potential security concerns.</p>

  <p>The following domains that you manage continue to be flagged by our analysis for potential
    security concerns. This may be because the registrants have not completed the requisite steps
    to mitigate the potential security abuse and/or have it reviewed and delisted.</p>

  {call .threatMatchTable}
    {param threats: $threats /}
  {/call}

  <p>Please work with the registrant to mitigate any security issues and have the
    domains delisted.</p>

  {call .resourceList}
    {param resources: $resources /}
  {/call}

  <p>You will continue to receive a monthly summary of all domains managed by your registrar
    that remain on our lists of potential security threats. You will additionally receive a daily
    notice when any new domains that are added to these lists. Once the registrant has resolved
    the security issues and followed the steps to have his or her domain reviewed and delisted
    it will automatically be removed from our monthly reporting.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact {$replyToEmail}.</p>

  Dear registrar partner,

    registrant to mitigate any security issues and have the domains delisted.</b></p>

  {call .resourceList}
    {param resources: $resources /}
  {/call}

  <p>You will continue to receive daily notices when new domains managed by your registrar
    are flagged for abuse, as well as a monthly summary of all of your domains under management
    that remain flagged for abuse. Once the registrant has resolved the security issues and
