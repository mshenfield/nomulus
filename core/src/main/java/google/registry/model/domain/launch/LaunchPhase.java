/**
 * The launch phase of the TLD being addressed by this command.
 *
 * <p>The launch phase refers to the various stages that a TLD goes through before entering general
 * availability. The various phases are described below (in order that they usually occur).
 *
 * <p>Each phase is connected to the TldState in which it can be used (see DomainFlowUtils). Sending
 * an EPP with the wrong launch phase for the current TldState will result in an error. However, we
 * don't actually check the launch phase *exists*.
 *
 * <p>We usually check for the information *inside* a launch phase (e.g. the signed mark for the
 * domain) and return an error if that is missing - which would also check that the phase exists.
 * But if we bypass the need for that information (e.g., an Anchor Tenant doesn't need a signed
 * mark), then we never actually test the phase exists.
 *
 * <p>This means an Anchor Tenant has some weird peculiarities: It doesn't need to specify the
 * phase. It *can* specify the phase, but not give any of the phase's information (e.g. - signed
 * marks), in which case we accept even a wrong phase. But if it *does* give a signed mark as well -
 * we will return an error if it's the wrong phase (or if the marks are invalid) even though we
 * didn't require them.
 *
 * <p>This is OK (?) because the Anchor Tenants field is set internally and manually. The person who
 * sets it is the one that needs to make sure the domain isn't a trademark and that the fields are
 * correct.
