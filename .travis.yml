# Collecting report files from a travis build to GCS requires setting the
# "CREDZ" and "REPORT_GCS_BUCKET" environment variables in your travis
# repository.
#
# The report destination can be any GCS path (e.g. "gcs://bucket-name/path").
# You'll want to select "Display value in build log", otherwise travis will
# hide the bucket name in the URL that is displayed.
#
# The CREDZ variable should be the contents of a json credentials file for
# a service account with write access to the bucket, escaped for bash shell
# usage (usually just wrapping it in single quotes should suffice).
