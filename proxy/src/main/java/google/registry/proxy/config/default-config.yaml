# This is the default configuration file for the proxy. Do not make changes to
# it unless you are writing new features that requires you to. To customize an

# to override some of these values to configure and enable some services used in

gcpScopes:
  # The default OAuth scope granted to GCE instances. Local development instance
  # needs this scope to mimic running on GCE. Currently it is used to access
  # Cloud KMS and Stackdriver Monitoring APIs.

  # The OAuth scope required to be included in the access token for the GAE app
  # to authenticate.
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email

# Refresh the access token 5 minutes before it expires.
#
# Depending on how the credential is obtained, its renewal behavior is
# different. A credential backed by a private key (like the ADC obtained
# locally) will get a different token when #refreshToken() is called. On GCE,
# the credential is just a wrapper around tokens sent from the metadata server,
# which is valid from 3599 seconds to 1699 seconds (this is no documentation on
# this, I got this number by logging in a GCE VM, calling curl on the metatdata
# server every minute, and check the expiration time of the response). Calling
# refreshToken() does *not* get a new token. The token is only refreshed by
# metadata server itself (every 3599 - 1699 = 1900 seconds).
#
# We refresh the token 5 minutes before it expires, which should work in both
# cases. This is better than caching the token for a pre-defined period, because
# even right after #refreshToken() is called on the client side, tokens obtained
# from GCE metadata server may not be valid for the entirety of 3599 seconds.
