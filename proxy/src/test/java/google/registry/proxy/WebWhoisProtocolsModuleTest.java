/**
 * End-to-end tests for {@link WebWhoisProtocolsModule}.
 *
 * <p>This protocol defines a connection in which the proxy behaves as a standard http server (sans
 * the redirect operation which is excluded in end-to-end testing). Because non user-defined
 * handlers are used, the tests here focus on verifying that the request written to the network
 * socket by a client is reconstructed faithfully by the server, and vice versa, that the response a
 * client decoded from incoming bytes is equivalent to the response sent by the server.
 *
 * <p>These tests only ensure that the server represented by this protocol is compatible with a
 * client implementation provided by Netty itself. They test the self-consistency of various Netty
 * handlers that deal with HTTP protocol, but not whether the handlers converts between bytes and
 * HTTP messages correctly, which is presumed correct.
 *
 * <p>Only the HTTP redirect protocol is tested as both protocols share the same handlers except for
 * those that are excluded ({@code SslServerInitializer}, {@code WebWhoisRedirectHandler}).
